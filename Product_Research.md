# MIXED REALITY WITH HOLOLENS 2 IN HEALTHCARE

Though the applications of **HoloLens 2** are innumerable, our focus is _healthcare_. HoloLens will transform the nursing profession and improve healthcare. With the advent of telemedicine, the need for the patient and clinician to sit behind two screen with compartmentalized view of each other's world will be replaced by allowing clinicians to send themselves into patient's environment and interact more realistically. Nurses can teach patients about their upcoming surgery or provide detailed discharge instructions using hologram modeling of organs, medical devices, and procedures. HoloLens can also be used as a medium for patients to illustrate their lives and garner empathy from healthcare providers.

These benefits aren't some future plans but are already in practice by various organizations. **Medivis** is one such organization where they have used HoloLens and have experienced reduced procedure times, complication rates and radiation exposure. **ApoQlar** is another such organization who were benefitted tremendously when explaining procedures to patients because they were able to illustrate everything with interactive 3D imagery.
