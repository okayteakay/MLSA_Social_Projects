# 1. Mixed Reality


Holograms are to Sci-Fi movies as sugar is to milk. 

From Terminator to Avengers, we cannot imagine our favourite superheroes without their mighty, futuristic holograms. In the [2012 short-film Sight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK_cdkpazjI), we see the protagonist Patrick living in an augmented space created by his highly nouvelle technology. [An IMDb review](https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3003534/?ref_=tt_urv) of this film writes, _“it was very well done indeed and I was thoroughly held by this future.”_ .

What was captivatingly futuristic to an average person only a decade ago, a far-fetched ideology,  is now a reality,  driving innovation and smart-living to enrich human lives. Popularized by Pokemon GO and Snapchat filters, extended reality is now a part of every major sector of the society.

Extended Reality is the broad umbrella encompassing Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality and Mixed Reality. While you might have heard about Virtual Reality, a concept that [dates back to the 1800s](https://www.fi.edu/virtual-reality/history-of-virtual-reality), and being used extensively in gaming and entertainment, Mixed Reality is a fairly new term.

## What is Mixed Reality?

While Virtual Reality primarily focuses on providing the users fully immersive digital experiences by moving them away from the real world, Mixed Reality takes a slightly different approach, focusing on bridging the gap between real and digital elements. Through Mixed Reality applications, users get to interact with both the virtual and the real worlds, manipulate digital objects using real-world ones, and vice versa. Sounds appealing, doesn’t it?

Let us now look at the origins of this (Marvel)lous technology!

## History of Mixed Reality

The term “mixed reality” was first coined in “[A Taxonomy of mixed reality Visual Displays](https://search.ieice.org/bin/summary.php?id=e77-d_12_1321)”, a 1994 paper by Paul Milgram and Fumio Kishino, which explored the concept of ‘virtuality continuum’. 
The reality-virtuality continuum is the scale between reality(the physical world) and virtuality(the virtual world). Mixed Reality was, according to Milgram, a technology that aimed at blending these two ends of the spectrum.

Though MR has its origins rooted in the 1990s, it is safe to say that the term was only popularized by Microsoft, when they launched the [Microsoft HoloLens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens) in 2016. 
The HoloLens are a pair of mixed reality smart glasses, the first head-mounted display, running on the Windows Mixed Reality platform. (We will know more about HoloLens in further blog posts.)

In recent years, mixed reality has zoomed through the technological space with its wide range of applications and even bigger future possibilities. According to a [research by  Allied Market Research](https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/mixed-reality-market), the mixed reality market is estimated to be around $5,362.1 Million by the year 2024. Some techies are even referring to MR as the next big thing in technology, following Artificial Intelligence.

## Realizing Mixed Reality’s Immense Potential

“Mixed Reality is more than just a tool for gaming and cinema, but a way to improve human life in all its facets.”  It is no shocker that a device like HoloLens would find its place in schools, industries, hospitals and a variety of other professions. Powered by innovation and rapid growth in technology, mixed reality has the potential to become the powerhouse of education, health-care and industrial sectors.

The MR app [HoloHuman](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/holohuman/9n5brls1hmw2#activetab=pivot:overviewtab) is a pioneer in the field of education. It is a complete human anatomy atlas that allows students to explore body systems, functions and regions through the use of full-size, interactive holograms. 
(The use of this technology in health-care will be discussed in further blog posts.)
MR solutions like Hevolus, Kognitiv Spark, PTC and Trimble are leading the way in other industries.

## How does MR tie in with other happening technologies?

Although MR is an astounding technology on its own, its true prospects can only be realized by taking advantage of its ability to blend seamlessly with other buzzing technologies, to provide users with breathtaking experiences. 

By incorporating Artificial Intelligence into mixed reality solutions, we can take user experiences to the next level by helping the digital elements respond intelligently to user inputs and inculcate smoother interactions.

[Speed Shopper](https://speedshopperlist.com/) is an e-commerce app that shoppers can use to take smart directions to locate their favorite products in grocery stores. This app uses AI to reinvent how retailers shop their favorite products. Its main focus is to get you in and out of a grocery store as quickly as possible.

## The Future of MR

Mixed Reality is actively being used in many industries today. But, at present, this field is still in its budding stages. Mixed Reality applications are still finding their feet in the technical world. 

After all, this technology is relatively new and is prone to many apprehensions. The lack of proper input devices coupled with the high cost of use is still holding it back. Research and developments are being made in this field to make it more easily accessible for daily use and provide end-users with immersive and striking experiences.

All in all, as long as we prioritize innovation to optimize mainstream and professional environments, and as long as Spiderman’s holograms put you at awe, the field of Mixed Reality will thrive and keep thriving.
