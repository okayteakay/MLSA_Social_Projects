# 1. Mixed Reality


Holograms are to Sci-Fi movies as sugar is to milk. 

From Terminator to Avengers, we cannot imagine our favourite superheroes without their mighty, futuristic holograms. In the [2012 short-film Sight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK_cdkpazjI), we see the protagonist Patrick living in an augmented space created by his highly nouvelle technology. [An IMDb review](https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3003534/?ref_=tt_urv) of this film writes, _“it was very well done indeed and I was thoroughly held by this future.”_ .

What was captivatingly futuristic to an average person only a decade ago, a far-fetched ideology,  is now a reality,  driving innovation and smart-living to enrich human lives. Popularized by Pokemon GO and Snapchat filters, extended reality is now a part of every major sector of the society.

Extended Reality is the broad umbrella encompassing Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality and Mixed Reality. While you might have heard about Virtual Reality, a concept that [dates back to the 1800s](https://www.fi.edu/virtual-reality/history-of-virtual-reality), and being used extensively in gaming and entertainment, Mixed Reality is a fairly new term.

## What is Mixed Reality?

While Virtual Reality primarily focuses on providing the users fully immersive digital experiences by moving them away from the real world, Mixed Reality takes a slightly different approach, focusing on bridging the gap between real and digital elements. Through Mixed Reality applications, users get to interact with both the virtual and the real worlds, manipulate digital objects using real-world ones, and vice versa. Sounds appealing, doesn’t it?

Let us now look at the origins of this (Marvel)lous technology!

## History of Mixed Reality

The term “mixed reality” was first coined in “[A Taxonomy of mixed reality Visual Displays](https://search.ieice.org/bin/summary.php?id=e77-d_12_1321)”, a 1994 paper by Paul Milgram and Fumio Kishino, which explored the concept of ‘virtuality continuum’. 
The reality-virtuality continuum is the scale between reality(the physical world) and virtuality(the virtual world). Mixed Reality was, according to Milgram, a technology that aimed at blending these two ends of the spectrum.

Though MR has its origins rooted in the 1990s, it is safe to say that the term was only popularized by Microsoft, when they launched the [Microsoft HoloLens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens) in 2016. 
The HoloLens are a pair of mixed reality smart glasses, the first head-mounted display, running on the Windows Mixed Reality platform. (We will know more about HoloLens in further blog posts.)

In recent years, mixed reality has zoomed through the technological space with its wide range of applications and even bigger future possibilities. According to a [research by  Allied Market Research](https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/mixed-reality-market), the mixed reality market is estimated to be around $5,362.1 Million by the year 2024. Some techies are even referring to MR as the next big thing in technology, following Artificial Intelligence.

## Realizing Mixed Reality’s Immense Potential

“Mixed Reality is more than just a tool for gaming and cinema, but a way to improve human life in all its facets.”  It is no shocker that a device like HoloLens would find its place in schools, industries, hospitals and a variety of other professions. Powered by innovation and rapid growth in technology, mixed reality has the potential to become the powerhouse of education, health-care and industrial sectors.

The MR app [HoloHuman](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/holohuman/9n5brls1hmw2#activetab=pivot:overviewtab) is a pioneer in the field of education. It is a complete human anatomy atlas that allows students to explore body systems, functions and regions through the use of full-size, interactive holograms. 
(The use of this technology in health-care will be discussed in further blog posts.)
MR solutions like Hevolus, Kognitiv Spark, PTC and Trimble are leading the way in other industries.

## How does MR tie in with other happening technologies?

Although MR is an astounding technology on its own, its true prospects can only be realized by taking advantage of its ability to blend seamlessly with other buzzing technologies, to provide users with breathtaking experiences. 

By incorporating Artificial Intelligence into mixed reality solutions, we can take user experiences to the next level by helping the digital elements respond intelligently to user inputs and inculcate smoother interactions.

[Speed Shopper](https://speedshopperlist.com/) is an e-commerce app that shoppers can use to take smart directions to locate their favorite products in grocery stores. This app uses AI to reinvent how retailers shop their favorite products. Its main focus is to get you in and out of a grocery store as quickly as possible.

## The Future of MR

Mixed Reality is actively being used in many industries today. But, at present, this field is still in its budding stages. Mixed Reality applications are still finding their feet in the technical world. 

After all, this technology is relatively new and is prone to many apprehensions. The lack of proper input devices coupled with the high cost of use is still holding it back. Research and developments are being made in this field to make it more easily accessible for daily use and provide end-users with immersive and striking experiences.

All in all, as long as we prioritize innovation to optimize mainstream and professional environments, and as long as Spiderman’s holograms put you at awe, the field of Mixed Reality will thrive and keep thriving.





# 7. Case Study - apoQlar


<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79788102/159345132-fb54b3e2-8c03-4f49-866d-6e580bc894a9.png" height="200">


The mid-2010s saw rapid technological advances in both virtual reality and augmented reality. The possibilities of incorporating these technologies into our daily lives seemed endless and a paradigm shift in the design of human-computer interactions was just around the corner.

At the same time, scientists, computer technologists and healthcare professionals began to see, study and understand the potential impact a technology like mixed reality could have in delivering proper, efficient and more accessible healthcare. 

But, there were limitations to this. Mixed reality systems were complex and inaccessible. They required specialized prototypes for professional use.
This changed when commercial products like Microsoft HoloLens were released into the market. 
This was when apoQlar, a Germany-based company, managed to align itself in the field of holomedicine.



## About apoQlar

apoQlar was founded in 2017 by Lukasz Radomski and Sirko Pelzl at Hamburg, Germany. The company was established with the motive of “revolutionizing how medicine is practiced, experienced, learned and shared globally.” And rightfully so, apoQlar had opened a new chapter for Holomedicine. 

[VSI HoloMedicine by apoQlar](https://apoqlar.com/) is a software platform that leverages the Microsoft HoloLens 2 hardware to transform medical images, clinical workflows and medical education into a 3D mixed reality environment the world has never seen before. With VSI(Virtual Surgery Intelligence) HoloMedicine, MRI, CT and other medical scans are displayed in 3D through Microsoft HoloLens, facilitating a closer observation and analysis of patient data.
In 2020, apoQlar was a finalist in the Microsoft Partner of the Year Awards, for going above and beyond to enhance technical capabilities in the healthcare field.

## A Paradigm Shift

VSI HoloMedicine has brought tremendous improvements in clinical care, medical education and general overview of the patients. Dr. Robert Hannan, MD - Cardiovascular Surgeon, noted that VSI was “going to revolutionize not only healthcare, but also how we work together over distance, how we work together over time.” 

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79788102/159345272-759f8cdc-905d-4de1-9e3e-e768e27cdddc.png" width="380">

With the advancements led by apoQlar, it has now become incredibly easy for surgeons to collaborate on complex medical procedures from afar, through the mixed reality space. Patient data is easily examined through interactive holograms to help surgeons make accurate decisions.

## Challenges

Although VSI has already solidified its importance, apoQlar recognized that the safe and compliant handling of patient data with consideration to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was a hurdle that had to be overcome: Videos and images that could be informative for the rest of the medical community or for other patients could not be passed on easily and quickly, because all patient data has to be manually and elaborately anonymized by the doctor before being passed on.

With the help of the software [BlueGDPR](https://theblue.ai/blue-gdpr-optimizes-apoqlar-solution-vsi/), VSI HoloMedicine has incorporated the ability to automatically anonymize patient information. Large amounts of data are now automatically and professionally anonymized within the VSI immediately without being edited manually by the user of VSI.

## Where is apoQlar Heading?

In February 2022, apoQlar officially released the 1.8.0 version of VSI HoloMedicine. With this latest release, apoQlar became the first company to implement cloud-based rendering technologies for medical mixed reality across multiple continents.

As the need for accurate and accessible medical technology continues to grow, mixed reality solutions like apoQlar have and will become crucial for advancement in the field of healthcare.
