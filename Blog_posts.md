# 1. Mixed Reality


Holograms are to Sci-Fi movies as sugar is to milk. 

From Terminator to Avengers, we cannot imagine our favourite superheroes without their mighty, futuristic holograms. In the [2012 short-film Sight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK_cdkpazjI), we see the protagonist Patrick living in an augmented space created by his highly nouvelle technology. [An IMDb review](https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3003534/?ref_=tt_urv) of this film writes, _“it was very well done indeed and I was thoroughly held by this future.”_ .

What was captivatingly futuristic to an average person only a decade ago, a far-fetched ideology,  is now a reality,  driving innovation and smart-living to enrich human lives. Popularized by Pokemon GO and Snapchat filters, extended reality is now a part of every major sector of the society.

Extended Reality is the broad umbrella encompassing Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality and Mixed Reality. While you might have heard about Virtual Reality, a concept that [dates back to the 1800s](https://www.fi.edu/virtual-reality/history-of-virtual-reality), and being used extensively in gaming and entertainment, Mixed Reality is a fairly new term.

## What is Mixed Reality?

While Virtual Reality primarily focuses on providing the users fully immersive digital experiences by moving them away from the real world, Mixed Reality takes a slightly different approach, focusing on bridging the gap between real and digital elements. Through Mixed Reality applications, users get to interact with both the virtual and the real worlds, manipulate digital objects using real-world ones, and vice versa. Sounds appealing, doesn’t it?

Let us now look at the origins of this (Marvel)lous technology!

## History of Mixed Reality

The term “mixed reality” was first coined in “[A Taxonomy of mixed reality Visual Displays](https://search.ieice.org/bin/summary.php?id=e77-d_12_1321)”, a 1994 paper by Paul Milgram and Fumio Kishino, which explored the concept of ‘virtuality continuum’. 
The reality-virtuality continuum is the scale between reality(the physical world) and virtuality(the virtual world). Mixed Reality was, according to Milgram, a technology that aimed at blending these two ends of the spectrum.

Though MR has its origins rooted in the 1990s, it is safe to say that the term was only popularized by Microsoft, when they launched the [Microsoft HoloLens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens) in 2016. 
The HoloLens are a pair of mixed reality smart glasses, the first head-mounted display, running on the Windows Mixed Reality platform. (We will know more about HoloLens in further blog posts.)

In recent years, mixed reality has zoomed through the technological space with its wide range of applications and even bigger future possibilities. According to a [research by  Allied Market Research](https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/mixed-reality-market), the mixed reality market is estimated to be around $5,362.1 Million by the year 2024. Some techies are even referring to MR as the next big thing in technology, following Artificial Intelligence.

## Realizing Mixed Reality’s Immense Potential

“Mixed Reality is more than just a tool for gaming and cinema, but a way to improve human life in all its facets.”  It is no shocker that a device like HoloLens would find its place in schools, industries, hospitals and a variety of other professions. Powered by innovation and rapid growth in technology, mixed reality has the potential to become the powerhouse of education, health-care and industrial sectors.

The MR app [HoloHuman](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/holohuman/9n5brls1hmw2#activetab=pivot:overviewtab) is a pioneer in the field of education. It is a complete human anatomy atlas that allows students to explore body systems, functions and regions through the use of full-size, interactive holograms. 
(The use of this technology in health-care will be discussed in further blog posts.)
MR solutions like Hevolus, Kognitiv Spark, PTC and Trimble are leading the way in other industries.

## How does MR tie in with other happening technologies?

Although MR is an astounding technology on its own, its true prospects can only be realized by taking advantage of its ability to blend seamlessly with other buzzing technologies, to provide users with breathtaking experiences. 

By incorporating Artificial Intelligence into mixed reality solutions, we can take user experiences to the next level by helping the digital elements respond intelligently to user inputs and inculcate smoother interactions.

[Speed Shopper](https://speedshopperlist.com/) is an e-commerce app that shoppers can use to take smart directions to locate their favorite products in grocery stores. This app uses AI to reinvent how retailers shop their favorite products. Its main focus is to get you in and out of a grocery store as quickly as possible.

## The Future of MR

Mixed Reality is actively being used in many industries today. But, at present, this field is still in its budding stages. Mixed Reality applications are still finding their feet in the technical world. 

After all, this technology is relatively new and is prone to many apprehensions. The lack of proper input devices coupled with the high cost of use is still holding it back. Research and developments are being made in this field to make it more easily accessible for daily use and provide end-users with immersive and striking experiences.

All in all, as long as we prioritize innovation to optimize mainstream and professional environments, and as long as Spiderman’s holograms put you at awe, the field of Mixed Reality will thrive and keep thriving.




# 5. HoloLens 2 and Healthcare


Mixed reality on HoloLens 2 is changing the game for the health industry – from planning and performing live surgeries, to seeing ultrasounds in 3D, to training doctors, surgeons and nurses to learn and understand human anatomy in new ways. 


This is just the tip of the iceberg! By the end of this blog your jaw will drop realizing the power of mixed reality on HoloLens 2 in healthcare!

Let's start thinking about the paradigm of healthcare. In fact there are many things that we look at healthcare is being tried and true. These are saying that oftentimes had been instilled into our daily practice which is

> "See one, do one, teach one"

This was coined by Dr.William Halstead in the 1980s, and it specifically referred to the fact that clinicians in the course of training need to see several types of procedures. They need to see several types of patients with certain conditions. They need to perform the procedures on the patients to gain some expertise. They eventually get to the top of the pyramid when they are able to communicate and teach others how to do this. 

As you can imagine this is a very narrow pyramid. And unfortunately that has created problems when we think of access to care. With virtual reality, with mixed reality, with augmented reality, we have tools now available to create immersive experience that can transform the opportunity for providing education and training. The fact that we also have to recognize is that the devices that are available now allow us to be able to change the way that we see the environment, to be able to see three-dimensional images and be able to understand how these images can interrelate with each other. It allows us to be able to not only see it but change the way that we look at the world. This is a quotes from Satya Nadella - 

> "When you change the way you see the world, you change the world you see."

And that’s exactly what we are talking about here with mixed reality. 

## What constitutes this technology?

When we think of mixed reality probably the very first thing we think of is the headset the HoloLens2.


That is a core part of it. But the analysis is actually being done in the back-end with a powerful platform on Azure called Microsoft Mesh and that allows us to be able to create the three-dimensional images, pull the data from different sources and be able to provide that level of interactivity in immersive nature. Additionally, Microsoft Mesh interfaces not just with the HoloLens but a variety of other types of technology tools such as PCs and mobile devices and other virtual reality headsets. So we can create an ecosystem of different types of devices that can be used by clinicians and patients as they are immersing themselves or working with individuals that are in the immersed environments.


Then on the top of that sits the applications. Dynamics 365 has allowed us to be able to create immersive experiences that connect us to different individuals. We now have the Microsoft Mesh app, Altspace VR apps and of course partners are building on these platforms and creating incredibly immersive and important types of clinical applications using Microsoft technologies. Microsoft Mesh plays an important role here. It is on Azure so there's a significant amount of AI that's been applicable. 


There is also an opportunity to collaborate. Imagine you are in a virtual conference room having an image of the particular organ in three dimensions in front of you. Rather than all of the participants being there just throughout a video conference, their avatars are there. And avatars can interact with the actual organ, dissect it, show particular areas and also have people look at different angles.


Okay, I'm not telling you fairy tales! All this is possible now with Microsoft Mesh. More recently Microsoft has announced that Mesh can be launched directly out of Microsoft Teams which gives individuals and organizations an opportunity by leveraging collaboration tools such as Teams for telehealth and then launch into these environments. This is an incredible opportunity to provide intersection between the different Microsoft products and that's exactly what Microsoft is doing. We are taking a look at all the different technologies that we have available today everything from azure to teams to dynamics and all the platforms that we have built on top of it including Mesh and integrating them all. But at the centre of all of this is healthcare data. If we think about how healthcare data needs to flow from all the different systems, this diagram eases our job of understanding.


It is divided into 3 parts. In the upper left hand part we are talking about insights and ability to understand the individual at a very personal level. That means we need to pull data not just from our environment but also from the electronic health record, other datasets and normalize that through open APIs and standards. In the process of bringing all these different datasets together on a common platform we now have the ability to apply artificial intelligence on top of it. We can potentially apply AI to transform some of the information into decisions and support ways that we can now act upon it. Then collaboration and coordination between patients and doctors continue.


## So how will this powerful HoloLens 2 transform healthcare industry and improve patient care?

We will discuss in brief 7 possible areas of transformation in healthcare industry.
	1. Nursing Education:
	The HoloLens will parlay nursing education in undreamed-of ways: from hologram modeling of organs and body systems to simulated hospital environments to virtually guided skills instruction. Good-bye live cadaver dissection, hello augmented world where every student has an opportunity to explore the dissection process. 
	Certain skills such as nasogastric tube insertion, urinary catheterization, and PICC line placement could be practiced virtually while professors provide step by step guidance visible on the students’ lens.
	2. Disaster Training
	The HoloLens can create simulated environments allowing nurses to safely but realistically train for disaster response. Just as NASA is using the HoloLens to explore the surface of Mars, so will nurses use the HoloLens to prepare for medical response to earthquakes, plane crashes, tsunamis, and terrorist attacks.
	3. Telemedicine
	No longer will patient and provider sit behind two screens with a compartmentalized view of each other’s world. The HoloLens could allow nurses to send themselves into the patient’s environment and interact more realistically.
	4. Emergency Response
	With the HoloLens, a call to 911 means the medical team can immediately see the emergency situation. When minutes and even seconds can matter, the HoloLens will allow clinicians to coach an uncertain bystander on first aid techniques such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation while waiting for medical professionals to arrive.
	5. Cultivating Understanding
	Patients may use the HoloLens as a form of self-expression. The schizophrenic individual may render an environment that reflects his struggle with auditory and visual hallucinations. The psychiatric nurse could then use the HoloLens to step into his world and truly experience a life plagued with hurtful voices and terrifying images. The HoloLens serves as a medium for patients to illustrate their lives and garner empathy from healthcare providers.
	6. Patient Education 
	Nurses can teach patients about their upcoming surgery or provide detailed discharge instructions using hologram modeling of organs, medical devices, and procedures.
	7. Personalized Prostheses
	Prostheses could be precisely tailored to the individual using holographic rendering and 3D printing made possible by the HoloLens. Using Microsoft HoloLens, a personalized prosthetic might be designed to fit the actual shape of the patient’s anatomy.
	
As the possible applications go endless, let's focus on clinical use cases. This can be broadly classified into three categories. 


The first is around holographic patient consultation. In the course of talking to the patient about a procedure or a particular type of intervention doctors oftentimes need to communicate information that go beyond words. A picture would be great. But a three-dimensional picture that one can look at is exactly what patients need. One example is Microsoft HoloLens combined with apoQlar's (covered later in this blog series) virtual surgery intelligence or VSI.


Now the second context is consultation and doctors would  love to be able to bring consultants in on every visit which is impractical in real time. But with virtual care and some of the tools that we have now available they can do remote expert consultation and have them available at the time that they're seeing the patient and have those consultants be able to see the same type of things that the individual clinician standing right in front of the patient. The Microsoft HoloLens2 in combination with the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Remote Assist enable clinicians from the National Health Services to be able to take care of COVID patients.


Finally, in terms of training simulations we will be able to understand the different anatomies to be able to provide procedures and enable junior clinicians to be able to practice in a safe setting but also teach them the proper way to do things and avoid certain aspects that could lead to danger. That’s something we now have available with these mixed reality applications. Again this scenario is a combination of the Microsoft HoloLens2 technologies with interactive Kahneman's hollow Anatomy application. This was done and tested at the Case Western  Reserve University.


## So much to take in!!!In a gist...

This is an opportunity to re-re-imagine what healthcare can be.



We're getting better insights by connecting surgeons and clinicians with the medical data that matters most, better experiences. Now students can perfect their skills by practicing on virtual tools that are in three dimensions. Then providing better care by allowing us to provide preoperative planning, post-operative analysis and better information that's provided to the patients as part of this overall experience. Throughout this, we are learning that mixed reality has an incredible potential to transform the way that we take care of patients and train clinicians across the world. 



# 7. Case Study - apoQlar


<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79788102/159345132-fb54b3e2-8c03-4f49-866d-6e580bc894a9.png" height="200">


The mid-2010s saw rapid technological advances in both virtual reality and augmented reality. The possibilities of incorporating these technologies into our daily lives seemed endless and a paradigm shift in the design of human-computer interactions was just around the corner.

At the same time, scientists, computer technologists and healthcare professionals began to see, study and understand the potential impact a technology like mixed reality could have in delivering proper, efficient and more accessible healthcare. 

But, there were limitations to this. Mixed reality systems were complex and inaccessible. They required specialized prototypes for professional use.
This changed when commercial products like Microsoft HoloLens were released into the market. 
This was when apoQlar, a Germany-based company, managed to align itself in the field of holomedicine.



## About apoQlar

apoQlar was founded in 2017 by Lukasz Radomski and Sirko Pelzl at Hamburg, Germany. The company was established with the motive of “revolutionizing how medicine is practiced, experienced, learned and shared globally.” And rightfully so, apoQlar had opened a new chapter for Holomedicine. 

[VSI HoloMedicine by apoQlar](https://apoqlar.com/) is a software platform that leverages the Microsoft HoloLens 2 hardware to transform medical images, clinical workflows and medical education into a 3D mixed reality environment the world has never seen before. With VSI(Virtual Surgery Intelligence) HoloMedicine, MRI, CT and other medical scans are displayed in 3D through Microsoft HoloLens, facilitating a closer observation and analysis of patient data.
In 2020, apoQlar was a finalist in the Microsoft Partner of the Year Awards, for going above and beyond to enhance technical capabilities in the healthcare field.

## A Paradigm Shift

VSI HoloMedicine has brought tremendous improvements in clinical care, medical education and general overview of the patients. Dr. Robert Hannan, MD - Cardiovascular Surgeon, noted that VSI was “going to revolutionize not only healthcare, but also how we work together over distance, how we work together over time.” 

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79788102/159345272-759f8cdc-905d-4de1-9e3e-e768e27cdddc.png" width="380">

With the advancements led by apoQlar, it has now become incredibly easy for surgeons to collaborate on complex medical procedures from afar, through the mixed reality space. Patient data is easily examined through interactive holograms to help surgeons make accurate decisions.

## Challenges

Although VSI has already solidified its importance, apoQlar recognized that the safe and compliant handling of patient data with consideration to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was a hurdle that had to be overcome: Videos and images that could be informative for the rest of the medical community or for other patients could not be passed on easily and quickly, because all patient data has to be manually and elaborately anonymized by the doctor before being passed on.

With the help of the software [BlueGDPR](https://theblue.ai/blue-gdpr-optimizes-apoqlar-solution-vsi/), VSI HoloMedicine has incorporated the ability to automatically anonymize patient information. Large amounts of data are now automatically and professionally anonymized within the VSI immediately without being edited manually by the user of VSI.

## Where is apoQlar Heading?

In February 2022, apoQlar officially released the 1.8.0 version of VSI HoloMedicine. With this latest release, apoQlar became the first company to implement cloud-based rendering technologies for medical mixed reality across multiple continents.

As the need for accurate and accessible medical technology continues to grow, mixed reality solutions like apoQlar have and will become crucial for advancement in the field of healthcare.
