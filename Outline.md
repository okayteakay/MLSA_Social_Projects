## 1. What is Mixed Reality?
In this blog, we discuss the concept of Mixed Reality, its definition and how it acts as a bridge between VR and AR. We also discuss the origins of MR, as we then move on to its vast range of applications and its significance, especially in the healthcare sector.

## 2. How is healthcare sector leveraging mixed reality?
Surgeons must be extremely accurate, focused, and analytical when doing medical procedures. During essential procedures, surgeons must consider a variety of factors in order to make the best decisions possible. Mixed reality essentially provides necessary assistance to not only surgeons but doctors in in three domains of healthcare - Analyzing patient scans in real time for proper diagnosis, providing interacting surgical training to young in-experienced doctors and by supporting surgeons with vital visual information during operations.

##3. Introduction to Hololens 2
Microsoft HoloLens 2 is one of the incredible mixed reality tools successfully connecting and blending physical and digital worlds together in augmented reality and virtual reality applications.For such an immersive experience it uses holographic computing. Now to put in layman words producing 3 ,dimensional figures and patterns. Hololens 2 first came into  existence by one of the brilliant minds, Alex Kipman. These are the new age , robocap like headsets manufactured by Microsoft and MicroVision.inc.
These are not just some dumb heasets givng a 3 dimensional projection of computed images, it rather a huge step towards future. It uses human and environment understanding with 
some pre-installed softwares. Nothing is perfect, it is the consistent effort to be the best, which makes things perfect ; Microsoft is the perfect stand on it.

##4. Features and Specs of Holoelens2
It allows a user to work hands-free and provide undivide, hassle free attention to the work. Some of the features include error freehand tracking, built-in voice commands, eye tracking, spatial mapping, and large field of view. It also allow the ease of use, as it can be easily used monitor and interact with the user's environment.It is not just 
a technology, but an actual ecosystem. This ecosystem is supported with security, reliability, and scalability of Microsoft Cloud.With some outstaanding features like built
in voice command, eye tracking, hand tracking, etc, what is actually needed is the accuracy, and Hololens 2 definately stands on the top of the charts when it comes to accuracy.



## 5. HoloLens 2 and Healthcare
The applications of this world-changing innovation is endless. But for this blog series, let's focus on healthcare. In this blog, we explore 7 mind-boggling areas where HoloLens 2 can be used to transform the nursing profession and improve patient care.

## 6. Medivis
This blog is a case study of Medivis, a New York City-based medical technology company founded by surgeons, radiologists and engineers. Medivis is using technological advancements in augmented reality and computer vision to create a holographic future for surgery.

## 7. ApoQlar
This blog is a case study of the Germany-based company ApoQlar, which offers mixed reality-enabled solutions to empower doctors, medical students and healthcare professionals perform and learn optimally, uncovering the true potential of technology in the healthcare industry. 

## 8. Summary
Towards the end of this blog, we summarize on the fundamentals of Mixed Reality and how it can be beneficial for healthcare practitioners. Healthcare is a field where decision making is crucial and most of the time, these split-second decisions may be the difference between life and death for patients. Thus, mixed reality provides assistance for decision making at several stages - health condition diagnosis, drug dosage, surgeries, etc. We narrow doen our focus on Hololens 2, a microsoft product developed spcifically for this purpose, describe its functionality and use cases while also briefing on example products.
